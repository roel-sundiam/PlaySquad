# PlaySquad Mobile Push Notifications Implementation

## Overview

PlaySquad now supports **true mobile push notifications** that work like iPhone alerts - sending notifications even when the app is closed or in the background. This implementation transforms PlaySquad from a web-only notification system to a mobile-ready PWA (Progressive Web App) with full push notification capabilities.

## âœ… What's Implemented

### 1. PWA Infrastructure
- **Web App Manifest** (`manifest.json`) - Enables mobile app installation
- **Service Worker** (`service-worker.js`) - Handles background notifications
- **Mobile-optimized icons** - PWA icons for all standard sizes (72px to 512px)
- **Angular asset configuration** - Proper build and deployment setup

### 2. Backend Push Notification Service
- **Web Push API integration** - Using industry-standard `web-push` library
- **VAPID keys configuration** - Secure push notification authentication
- **Push Subscription model** - Database storage for user device subscriptions
- **Multiple device support** - Users can receive notifications on multiple devices
- **Preference management** - Users can control notification types per device

### 3. Frontend Push Notification Management
- **Push Notification Service** (`PushNotificationService`) - Complete subscription management
- **Notification Settings UI** (`NotificationSettingsComponent`) - User-friendly interface
- **Permission handling** - Seamless browser permission requests
- **Device detection** - Automatic browser, OS, and device type identification
- **Real-time status updates** - Live subscription status and preferences

### 4. Complete API Endpoints
```
GET  /api/push-subscriptions/vapid-public-key    - Get VAPID public key
POST /api/push-subscriptions/subscribe           - Subscribe to push notifications
PUT  /api/push-subscriptions/preferences         - Update notification preferences
GET  /api/push-subscriptions/my-subscriptions    - Get user's device subscriptions
DELETE /api/push-subscriptions/unsubscribe       - Unsubscribe from notifications
POST /api/push-subscriptions/test               - Send test notification (dev only)
```

### 5. Integrated Notification Triggers
Push notifications are automatically sent for:
- **Event Published** - New event notifications to all club members
- **Event Cancelled** - Critical alerts to users who RSVP'd
- **Join Request Approved** - Welcome notifications to new club members
- **System Announcements** - Admin broadcasts (future feature)
